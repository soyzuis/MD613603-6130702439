    <h1>Sub Urban - Cirque</h1>
    <p><br />Lyrics:<br /> 
        <br />Hear her talkin' 'bout that mainstream<br /> 
        <br /> Got it real easy like she got the callback<br />
        <br />Droppin' underneath that eave breeze<br />
        <br />Wanna watch her knees weak<br />
        <br />When they pass my name back<br />
        <br />You know you sound c*cky as f*ck<br />
        <br />But go and try, good f*ckin' luck<br />
        <br />So if you ask to come and see me<br />
        <br />Show some f*ckin' dignity<br />
        <br />Don't tell me how to live life<br />
        <br /><br />
        <br />And I make it go (Boom), back at it again<br />
        <br />Don't need to be in love to have a little romance<br />
        <br />Sing it on the spot to watch the crowd dance<br />
        <br />And even if they're petrified, I hear their hearts prance<br />
        <br />And I can be free from raw tyranny<br />
        <br />Man, f*ck my emotions, they're ghostin' and moanin' all day on repeat<br />
        <br />(Woo)<br />
        <br /><br />
        <br />(Uh)<br />
        <br />We can fall in love or we can go insane<br />
        <br />We can play it rough or we can, we can play it safe<br />
        <br />Don't matter what's above, our destinies are made<br />
        <br /> Why give us f*ckin' lemons if I can just buy lemonade?<br />
        <br /><br />
        <br />And I make it go (Boom), back at it again<br />
        <br />Don't need to be in love to have a little romance<br />
        <br />Sing it on the spot to watch the crowd dance<br />
        <br />And even if they're petrified, I hear their hearts prance<br />
        <br />('Round and around we go)</p>
