    <h1>Sub Urban - Cirque</h1>
    <p>Lyrics:<br />
        Hear her talkin' 'bout that mainstream<br /> 
        Got it real easy like she got the callback
        Droppin' underneath that eave breeze
        Wanna watch her knees weak
        When they pass my name back
        You know you sound c*cky as f*ck
        But go and try, good f*ckin' luck
        So if you ask to come and see me
        Show some f*ckin' dignity
        Don't tell me how to live life
        
        And I make it go (Boom), back at it again
        Don't need to be in love to have a little romance
        Sing it on the spot to watch the crowd dance
        And even if they're petrified, I hear their hearts prance
        And I can be free from raw tyranny
        Man, f*ck my emotions, they're ghostin' and moanin' all day on repeat
        (Woo)
        
        (Uh)
        We can fall in love or we can go insane
        We can play it rough or we can, we can play it safe
        Don't matter what's above, our destinies are made
        Why give us f*ckin' lemons if I can just buy lemonade?
        
        And I make it go (Boom), back at it again
        Don't need to be in love to have a little romance
        Sing it on the spot to watch the crowd dance
        And even if they're petrified, I hear their hearts prance
        And I can be free from raw tyranny
        Man, f*ck my emotions, they’re ghostin' and moanin' all day on repeat
        
        ('Round and around we go)
        ('Round and around we go)</p>
